This respository contains ongoing molecular dynamics (MDline materials (HCC,FCC,BCC) using LAAMPS. The goal is to study deformation and failure mechanisms under various loading and thermalconditions.
## Folder Structure
- `crack/` -  Input scripts amd results for fracture simulations
- `friction/` - Atomic-scale friction simulations
- `notebooks/` - Python notebook for plotting and post-processing
- `common/` - shared data files, potentials, and setup scripts
## Tools Used 
- LAAMPS, OVITO, VMD
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Git, Github
## Status
This project is in progress. Results, scripts, and notebooks will be updated continuosly.
